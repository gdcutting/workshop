# Guy's Code Workshop

I recently finished my master's degree in Systems Science, and am now focused on polishing my data science and related skills as I begin to look for jobs. One lesson I learned in my graduate school journey is that there's a huge gap in data science education. I took quite a bit of graduate coursework in modeling, AI/ML, and related areas, and learned a tremendous amount. But there's still a shortage of hands-on instruction that will prepare people like me for being working data scientists.

My solution to this problem is to be independent and take charge myself of filling these gaps. I have most of the skills I need to do data science work, but am aware of needing to polish up in certain areas. There are tons of online educational resources (like Coursera), but my experience is that these are good as introductions but only take you so far. There are also more hands-on workshops like [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/https://www.thedataincubator.com/), but these seem pretty expensive for the amount of instruction, and I don't need to spend thousands more dollars on coursework.

I have spent the last couple of years compiling a library of great resources. Many of these are online, like guides/tutorials, package documentation, etc. The best resource I've found is technical books. A few that I've been working with are:

* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
* [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* [Mastering Machine Learning with scikit-learn](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Machine-Learning-with-scikit-learn-Second-Edition)

I'm working through these and other resources to get as many tools in my toolbox as I can. I also have a lot of code from class and other projects that I'd like to collect here. Some of the code is original, some makes use of code provided by others and extends it for experimental and learning purposes, and some is reproduced from tutorials and other resources which I am collecting in one place here in order to make it easy to refer to for future projects.
